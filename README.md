# androidApp
A simple android app with some a little of Machine Learning (Image classification)

Just a basic and simple app that has a plain button, placed down in the main activity window.
From that button the user can open the camera and then he can take a picture of the flower 
and indicates if that is a Margarita, a rose or a tulip.

For the training of the model I used using custom vision from cognitive services of Microsoft
(here you can find more: https://www.customvision.ai/).

The propability of its image is not very accurate. That can be resolve by training the model 
with more images of each flower type or maybe add more.
